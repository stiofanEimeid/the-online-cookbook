## Automated Testing

## Client Stories Testing

As a user, I want to find and share recipes. I want to be able to create an account that is secure and keeps track of the recipes I create, allowing me to update them and delete them as I please. 

As a site owner, I want to promote a brand of cooking tools to my users. I sought to accomplish this by making a direct connection between the recipes users were making and viewing and the tools I wished to promote and sell. The tools are presented to users as facilitating their needs and interests.
